# Apollo Frontend

The frontend is built with react and uses next.js.

## Setup

In order to run the frontend, run

```
npm install
```

from within `frontend`. Once this is done, simply run

```
npm run dev
```

This should serve the application on `localhost:8080`.

Other commands (build, start, export) can be run analoguously.
